!!! abstract "summary" 
    
    Resource utilization appears nominal throughout, only fluctuating with daily traffic volume.

    !!! quote ""

        (Opt) Both Elasticsearch and Kibana's Proxy Log response times suggest no significant change in overall traffic nor response times for the last month. However, there are now low volume Kibana `bsearch` requests taking +5s. Elasticsearch _maybe_ has time-correlative `_msearch` spikes but it's hard to guarantee if those are related.

    ??? quote "nominal utilization"

        !!! example "CAT alternatives"

            The Elasticsearch API pages for CAT ("compact and aligned text") prefix with warning

            > ‚ö†Ô∏è CAT APIs are only intended for human consumption using the command line or Kibana console. They are not intended for use by applications. For application consumption, use ...

            For mapping to backing JSON-response API's, see [Elasticsearch CAT Alternatives](https://medium.com/@stefnestor/elasticsearch-cat-alternatives-315f72ea6d5e). 

            Note that since Elasticsearch diagnostics are not stateful (aka they pull API's in quick succession but do not capture the singular state of all of the the databases' APIs all at once), then results between CAT APIs and sister JSON-response APIs will not be exact.


        CAT Nodes ([v8](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/v8/operation/operation-cat-nodes), [v7](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/cat-nodes.html)) would appear
