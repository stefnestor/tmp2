TODO

- needs to show 
    - cluster pending tasks (empty)
    - node threadpool (no hits)
        - show both `awk` and `grep` to filter output
    - node tasks (shows opaque id from discover hitting hogwarts taking 5s)
        - how [Elasticsearch Tasks](https://medium.com/@stefnestor/elasticsearch-tasks-a77f6b0cb558) work
        - how check [Task Manager API's `description` and `headers`](https://support.elastic.co/knowledge/36562c17) 
- should problem box into data view runtime mapping being problem
    - will just say on Zoom or in email had user recreate data view via UI and it didn't experience issue (as can't add runtime mappings in UI)


After this they'll go to [green](green.md) (which'll be added to image).
